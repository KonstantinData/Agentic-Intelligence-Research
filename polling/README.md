# Polling Module

**Status**: Implemented in `agents/event_polling_agent.py`

This functionality is now part of the main agent-based architecture. Event polling from Google Calendar is handled by the `EventPollingAgent` which is orchestrated by the `MasterWorkflowAgent`.

## Current Implementation

- **Usage**: Automatically invoked by `MasterWorkflowAgent.run_workflow()`
- **Configuration**: Uses settings from `config/config.py` for date ranges

## Key Features

- Google Calendar API integration
- Configurable date range polling (lookahead/lookback days)
- Event filtering and processing
- Error handling and logging

For implementation details, see the `EventPollingAgent` class in the agents module.
