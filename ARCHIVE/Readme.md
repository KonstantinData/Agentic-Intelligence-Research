# Archive Folder

This folder contains legacy, deprecated, or superseded scripts and files that are no longer actively used in the main workflow of this repository.

## Purpose

- **Preservation:** Important code and logic that may be useful for reference, audits, or future inspiration are kept here rather than being deleted.
- **Clarity:** Keeps the main project directory clean, focused only on actively maintained and relevant code.
- **Transparency:** New contributors can understand the evolution of the codebase and see which approaches or structures have been replaced.

## Guidelines

- Only move files here if they are genuinely obsolete, replaced, or not intended for current production or development use.
- Do **not** import code from the `archive` folder in active scripts.
- Add a short comment to each file explaining why it was archived if possible.

## Restoring Files

If you need to restore or reuse code from this folder, consider whether it should be updated to match the current architecture before moving it back to the main workspace.
