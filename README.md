# Agentic Intelligence Research

Agentic Intelligence Research is a modular toolkit for building agent-based process automation workflows. The components focus on orchestrating calendar-driven business processes, collecting the necessary context, requesting human confirmation when required, and handing off curated events to downstream systems such as CRMs or knowledge bases.

The repository is organised as a set of focused agents, supporting utilities, and integration helpers that can be combined to automate a variety of follow-up tasks after calendar events are created.

## Quick start

1. **Create a Python environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

All configuration is driven through environment variables or a `.env` file. The [`config/README.md`](config/README.md) file describes every supported setting, including Google OAuth credentials, local log storage paths, and optional trigger word overrides.

## Running the orchestrator

The orchestrator wires the agents together and coordinates polling, enrichment, and escalation flows:

```bash
python -m agents.workflow_orchestrator
```

Individual agents can also be instantiated and exercised directly for targeted tests or integrations.

## Repository structure

- **[`agents/`](agents/README.md):** Core workflow agents for polling, trigger detection, extraction, human-in-the-loop coordination, local persistence, and orchestration.
- **[`integration/`](integration/README.md):** Google Calendar and Google Contacts API integrations, including OAuth token handling.
- **[`config/`](config/README.md):** Centralised configuration loader and trigger word resources.
- **[`logs/`](logs/README.md):** Structured event/workflow logging backed by the local filesystem.
- **[`log_storage/`](log_storage/README.md):** Default on-disk location for generated event and workflow logs.
- **[`utils/`](utils/README.md):** Cross-cutting utilities for text normalisation, trigger loading, and duplicate detection.
- **[`templates/`](templates/README.md):** Shared communication templates (emails, notifications).
- **[`extraction/`](extraction/README.md):** Extension point for advanced data extraction pipelines.
- **[`human_in_the_loop/`](human_in_the_loop/README.md):** Modules dedicated to manual review, approval, and confirmation flows.
- **[`polling/`](polling/README.md):** Scheduling and trigger polling concepts that feed the automation workflows.
- **[`reminders/`](reminders/README.md):** Reminder and escalation helpers built on top of the email agent.
- **[`tests/`](tests/README.md):** Automated test suite covering core agents, integrations, and utilities.
- **[`ARCHIVE/`](ARCHIVE/Readme.md):** Legacy experiments retained for reference.

## Development workflow

1. **Implement automation logic** within the relevant agent or module.
2. **Update configuration defaults** in `config/config.py` and document any new variables.
3. **Add templates or logging helpers** as required.
4. **Extend or write tests** in `tests/` to capture the expected behaviour.
5. **Run the test suite** (see `tests/README.md`) before opening a pull request.

## Logging and observability

Dedicated log managers in [`logs/`](logs/README.md) persist event and workflow logs on the local filesystem. Generated log artefacts default to [`log_storage/run_history`](log_storage/README.md), keeping them out of the repository root. The `MasterWorkflowAgent` exposes a `finalize_run_logs` helper that the orchestrator calls after each run to record log metadata.

## Data handling and compliance

The platform masks sensitive organiser or attendee information before it is logged or shared with human reviewers. The [`utils/pii.py`](utils/pii.py) module provides the `mask_pii` helper used across agents to redact emails, phone numbers, personal names, and similar identifiers while preserving whitelisted business context such as `company_name` or `web_domain`.

Key guidelines:

- **Never log raw PII.** Agents call `mask_pii` before logging events, trigger results, or human-response details. When adding new logging statements that include user-provided payloads, wrap them with the helper (e.g., `logger.info("Payload: %s", mask_pii(payload))`).
- **Sanitise human-facing messages when compliance mode requires it.** The `HumanInLoopAgent` automatically redacts personal fields before composing confirmation requests when `settings.mask_pii_in_messages` is enabled.
- **Tune compliance by configuration.** Environment variables control how aggressive the masking is:
  - `COMPLIANCE_MODE` accepts `standard` (default) or `strict`. Strict mode enables message masking and expands numeric redaction.
  - `MASK_PII_IN_LOGS` and `MASK_PII_IN_MESSAGES` provide explicit toggles when a deployment needs to override the mode defaults.
  - `PII_FIELD_WHITELIST` lets you append additional business-safe fields (comma-separated) that should never be redacted.

Automated tests under [`tests/test_pii_masking.py`](tests/test_pii_masking.py) assert that masked logs never leak organiser emails and that human-facing messages honour the compliance toggles. Any new features that surface event data should include equivalent safeguards.

## Human-in-the-loop interactions

Human feedback is requested through the `HumanInLoopAgent`, which can work with a pluggable communication backend (email, Slack, etc.) or fall back to simulated responses. The [`human_in_the_loop/`](human_in_the_loop/README.md) directory documents patterns for custom manual review steps.
