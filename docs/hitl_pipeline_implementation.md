# HITL Pipeline Implementation Notes

The HITL workflow polls an IMAP inbox for organiser replies, dispatches them to
workflow handlers, and escalates outstanding items over email. All runtime
configuration is provided by `config.settings` and sourced from the environment.
The variables below describe the communication and policy levers that affect the
pipeline.

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP relay used by `EmailAgent` for outbound notifications. | _unset_ |
| `SMTP_PORT` | Port for the SMTP relay. | `465` |
| `SMTP_USERNAME` | Username for SMTP authentication (`SMTP_USER` accepted as an alias). | _unset_ |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | Password for SMTP authentication (`SMTP_PASS` alias supported). | _unset_ |
| `SMTP_SENDER` | Sender address used in outbound email (falls back to `SMTP_FROM` or the SMTP username). | _unset_ |
| `SMTP_SECURE` | Enables implicit TLS when sending email. | `true` |
| `IMAP_HOST` | IMAP server hosting the HITL inbox. | _unset_ |
| `IMAP_PORT` | Port for the IMAP server. | `993` |
| `IMAP_USERNAME` | Username for IMAP authentication (`IMAP_USER` alias supported). | _unset_ |
| `IMAP_PASSWORD` | Password for IMAP authentication (`IMAP_PASS` alias supported). | _unset_ |
| `IMAP_MAILBOX` | Mailbox or folder name that should be polled (`IMAP_FOLDER` alias supported). | `INBOX` |
| `IMAP_USE_SSL` | Enables SSL/TLS for IMAP connections (`IMAP_SSL` alias supported). | `true` |
| `HITL_INBOX_POLL_SECONDS` | Polling cadence (seconds) for `InboxAgent`. | `60.0` |
| `HITL_TIMEZONE` | Timezone used when scheduling reminder notifications. | `Europe/Berlin` |
| `HITL_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Primary administrator contact for escalations. | _unset_ |
| `HITL_ESCALATION_EMAIL` | Distribution list for escalation notifications. | _unset_ |
| `HITL_ADMIN_REMINDER_HOURS` | Comma-separated schedule (in hours) for HITL admin reminders. | `24.0` |

When extending the pipeline ensure new components read from `config.settings`
instead of `os.getenv` so that tests and alternative configuration sources remain
consistent.

## Automatic Continuations via InboxAgent

The workflow orchestrator installs `_handle_inbox_reply` as an inbox handler so
that organiser responses automatically drive the pending audit lifecycle. When a
follow-up is scheduled the orchestrator stores the audit context, including the
original event payload and requested fields, and waits for the inbox callback.
Incoming messages are normalised via `parse_missing_info_key_values` or
`parse_dossier_decision`, masked for logging, and then written to the audit log
before any business logic executes. The handler cancels outstanding reminder and
escalation tasks by delegating to the human agentâ€™s `ReminderEscalation`
instance, guaranteeing that a successful reply stops recurring emails.

`MasterWorkflowAgent` continuations receive the merged event information and the
normalised reply payload. Missing-info replies that now contain the necessary
keys result in an immediate CRM dispatch with the enriched dataset; otherwise
the human agent is consulted again and any new pending audit registrations are
forwarded back to the orchestrator. Dossier approvals behave similarly: complete
payloads trigger CRM dispatch, incomplete data falls back to the missing-info
flow, and negative replies short-circuit without further action. This handshake
captures audit history, clears reminders, and advances the workflow with a
single organiser email.
