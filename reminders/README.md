# Reminders Module

**Status**: Available but not integrated into main workflow

This module contains components for reminder and escalation workflows but is not currently part of the main agent-based workflow orchestrated by `MasterWorkflowAgent`.

## Current Implementation

- **Location**: `reminders/reminder_escalation.py`
- **Status**: Standalone module, not integrated with current architecture
- **Purpose**: Handle reminder and escalation workflows

## Future Integration

This module could be integrated into the main agent workflow by:
1. Creating a `ReminderAgent` following the current agent pattern
2. Adding it to `MasterWorkflowAgent` orchestration
3. Defining trigger conditions for reminder workflows

## Usage

Currently operates as a standalone module. For integration into the main workflow, follow the agent architecture patterns established in the `agents/` directory.
