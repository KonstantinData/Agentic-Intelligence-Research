# HumanInTheLoop simulates a step where a human must approve or supply missing information.
# In a real system, this could trigger an email, a web form, or a message to a dashboard.
# For demonstration, this implementation logs the request and auto-approves it,
# but you can replace the logic with e.g. input() or callback integration.
