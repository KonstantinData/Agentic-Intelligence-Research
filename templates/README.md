# Templates

Communication templates centralise the wording used by agents when contacting organisers,
stakeholders, or administrators.  Keeping templates in a dedicated package makes it easy to
update messaging without touching the automation logic.

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`email_templates.md`](email_templates.md) | Reference collection of subject/body patterns for reminders, escalations, and dossier confirmation requests. |

Feel free to add additional markdown, text, or HTML files to this package as the workflows
expand to cover more communication channels.
